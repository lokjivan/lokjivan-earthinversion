In case you suspect symptoms for COVID-19 (also during the quarantine period), CDC advices to log body temperature data two times a day for 14 days (see [here](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/pdf/COVID19-Temperature-Log-ENG-P.pdf)). The easiest way to log the data is digitally if you already uses iPhone (your data is all stored locally on device). There is a shortcut app on iPhone, that can be used to create several workflows for quickly executing simple tasks.

<p>In order to get the raw export, go into the “Apple Health” app, tap on your user icon and then select “Export All Health Data”. This export process may take a few minutes, and, once completed, you should then have a filed called “export.zip”. You can share the file with yourself via AirDrop, Email or any other method.
